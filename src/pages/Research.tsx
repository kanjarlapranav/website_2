      image: "/Assets/Images/Xurography.png",
      problem: "Traditional fabrication methods for metal thin film sensors are expensive, time-consuming, and often require specialized equipment that limits accessibility for many researchers. This creates a significant barrier to rapid iteration and innovation in medical sensor development.",
      solution: "We've developed a novel method using metal leaves and bench-top plotters to fabricate high-resolution patterns (<100 Î¼m) at approximately 1/5th the cost of conventional sputter-coated gold electrodes. This approach enables researchers to quickly prototype and test new sensor designs without requiring expensive cleanroom facilities.",

These procedures add complexity, cost, and potential safety concerns to the sensor manufacturing process, while also creating challenges for real-world deployment.",

These limitations hinder widespread adoption in resource-limited settings.",
